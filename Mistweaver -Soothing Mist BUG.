Class; Mistweaver
Spell: https://mop-shoot.tauri.hu/?spell=115175  
Spellname: Soothing Mist (channeled)
Where it Happens:  DUNGEONS and INSTANCES. 
BUG: The amount of healing done doesn't match the tooltip on the skill, the numbers are lower than they should be. If a spell says by calculation that it should heal 20k over 8 seconds.  When you cast it it is healing around 10% less than it should.
